# PyBer-Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to help the ride sharing company PyBer look at their data for three types of cities, Rural, Suburbs, and Urban cities. Analyzing this data should help the company see what types of cities have the most drivers and get the most money from fares. 

## Results
The table below shows what types of cities have the most rides and the highest dollar amount of fares.

As you can see the least total amount spent is in rural areas, but the amount spent per ride is higher. This is most likely due to the rides being a longer distance due to how spread out rural areas are. The most money total is in urban areas because the population is higher, and the rides would tend to be shorter because cities are usually more condensed. The data above shows five different data points.
- Total Rides: This is the total rides given between all drivers.
- Total Drivers: This is the total amount of drivers actively giving rides. 
- Total Fare: This is the total amount of money earned from each city type. 
- Average fare per ride: This is how much each ride earned on average.
- Average fare per driver: This is how much each driver has earned on average. 

The total fares by city type is displayed in the graph below.

The graph shows that there are similarities in all three types of cities based on date and total fare. The rural cities total fare is drastically less than urban areas. 

## Summary
Overall the data shows that urban areas make quite a bit more total money than rural areas, this is mostly due to population. Rural areas make more per ride, this might be due to the higher cost in rural areas and how far they must travel. Average fare per driver is quite low in the urban areas and one recommendation might be to decrease the number of drivers. There are 2,405 drivers compared to only 1,625 total rides. Increasing the amount of drivers by a small amount in rural and suburban areas may help accessing drivers easier so more people may be willing to use ride share in those areas.
