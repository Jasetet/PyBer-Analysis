# PyBer-Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to help the ride sharing company PyBer look at their data for each type of city. Analyizing this data should help the company see what types of cities have the most drivers and get the most money from fares. 

## Results

As you can see the least total amount spent is in rural areas but the amount spent per ride is higher. This is most likely due to the rides being a longer distance due to how spread out rural areas are. The most money total is in urban areas because the population is higher and the rides would tend to be shorter because cities are usually more condensed. The data above shows five different data points.
- Total Rides: This is the total rides given between all drivers.
- Total Drivers: This is the total amount of drivers activly giving rides. 
- Total Fare: This is the total amount of money earned from each city type. 
- Average fare per ride: This is how much each ride earned on average.
- Average fare per driver: This is how much each driver has earned on average.
